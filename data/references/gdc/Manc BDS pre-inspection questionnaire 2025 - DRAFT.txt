Q13. Please briefly summarise the assessment and delivery strategy for the programme including any
changes made since the last monitoring form

During term times: Predominantly EBL-based teaching with weekly corresponding symposia.
Small group teachings and seminars at the start of clinical and phantom-head sessions.
New since last inspection: Hybrid EBL and TBL-based teaching in the first two years

Clinical and non-clinical modules in each year; for example, tooth morphology; LA; Perio;
Prevention into Practice, Law, Ethics and Professionalism; Critical Appraisal Topic; Clinical
governance. Further information can be found in the Programme Handbook.
Assessment consists of a variety of written, clinical, and coursework components. Longitudinal
clinical assessment is done on every clinical encounter with patients or phantom head and
monitored via CAFs. CAFs also stores a record of observed milestones (clinical encounter
assessments) and written milestones (reflective case presentations). Successful completion of
clinical Gateways in clinical skills lab are a prerequisite to performing clinical procedures on
patients. There are clinical targets for each cohort of students. Quantitative and qualitative
measurement of clinical procedures and the quality of students' performance is monitored via
CAFS, known as observed and written 'milestones'.
Sign-up is a gateway prior to sitting the summative end-of-year exams, data from CAFs (and
legacy data from iDentity) is used in part to make this decision for each student (as well as
attendance, professionalism cards etc). The style of summative exams varies for different
cohorts of students and is appropriate for the level of knowledge or skills being assessed The
University of Manchester's Division of Dentistry employs a comprehensive, evidence-based
assessment strategy aligned with General Dental Council (GDC) requirements. Our approach
ensures students achieve clinical competence, professionalism, and readiness for independent
practice.
Key features include:
•
•

Formative Assessments: Regular feedback supports student learning and
development through activities such as clinical skills exercises and problem-based
learning sessions.
Summative Assessments: A variety of methods, including Multiple Choice Questions
(MCQs), Short Answer Papers (SAPs), Objective Structured Clinical Examinations
(OSCEs), and milestones, are used to evaluate knowledge, clinical competence, and
professionalism.

Gateways and Milestones: Clinical progression is tracked via observed and written
milestones, which assess capability in performing essential clinical tasks.
Standard Setting and Normalization: Exams are standard-set using robust methods
like Angoff and Borderline Regression Analysis to ensure fairness and uphold patient
safety.
Continuous Monitoring: Academic and clinical progress is tracked through the
iDentity e-portfolio system, ensuring students meet clinical targets and GDC-defined
standards.

This structured assessment framework ensures students are well-prepared to deliver safe and
effective patient care upon graduation.

Q15. Please add anything further you wish us to know about this programme

The BUPA outreach placements continue to be highly successful, cementing a long-term
partnership between BUPA and the University of Manchester (UoM) to enhance the
educational experience for our students. This collaboration provides primary care placements
at BUPA dental practices situated across Greater Manchester.
Starting from the 2024-25 academic year, four BUPA practices, each equipped with two dental
chairs, began hosting four students one day per week. From January 2025, two additional
practices with a similar setup will be integrated into the program, bringing the total to six
practices. Recruitment of clinical supervisors is ongoing, with active engagement and support
from UoM.
Looking ahead, our aim is to further expand the program to include more practices, continuing
to strengthen this valuable outreach initiative and providing exceptional learning opportunities
for our students.
Further positive development has been several of our staff members assuming new and
existing leadership positions. Their invaluable contributions have not only elevated the quality
of the program but have also effectively alleviated the workload on senior staff members. Their
dedication and expertise serve as significant assets in further advancing our educational
initiatives.
The University has invested in a brand-new Advanced Dental Education Centre (ADEC) on the
5th floor of the Carys Bannister building which is a state-of-the-art facility designed to improve
our students’ learning. Operated by the MFT Trust with 16 dental chairs, the facilities aims to
host our BDS students on 6 sessions per week, adding to their existing clinical timetable and
therefore providing them with more clinical practice.

Commented [LC8]: All this is what we said for the Feb 2024

Standards for Education mapping table (Annex One) Standard 1
Requirement 1: Students will provide patient care only when they have demonstrated adequate knowledge
and skills. For clinical procedures, the student should be assessed as competent in the relevant skills at
the levels required in the pre-clinical environments prior to treating patients
Describe, in detail, your plans for meeting the requirement and how these plans assure you that the
requirement is/will be met

Students begin developing clinical skills in the Clinical Skills Facility (CSF) during their second
year and retain access to this resource throughout the program. Weekly exercises in the CSF
are assessed, and students receive both verbal and written feedback, which is recorded on
Clinical Assessment Forms (CAFs). This ongoing feedback supports their progression and
identifies areas for improvement.
As students advance into clinical years, their competencies are evaluated through a structured
process called "Gateways." These Gateways assess a range of skills essential for safe patient
care, including preventive advice, restorative procedures (e.g., simple and complex fillings),
endodontic treatments, crowns, bridges, and other clinical tasks outlined in the Milestones and
Gateways Handbook. Gateways are conducted in simulated exam conditions, where students
perform procedures on typodonts or models. Completed work is submitted to tutors and
assessed using the H to I+ scale, with detailed marking criteria provided to students in advance
to guide their preparation.
To pass a Gateway, students must achieve a grade of Sp (satisfactory with practice
encouraged) or higher. While students who score Sp can progress without resitting the
Gateway, they are encouraged to practice further to refine their skills. Students achieving Sv
(satisfactory with minimal prompts) or I/I+ (independent) continue the course. However, a score
of U (unsatisfactory) or H (harm) necessitates remediation and resitting the Gateway after
further training. Students are allowed up to two resits; failure to pass after these attempts is
referred to a review panel, as detailed in the Milestones and Gateways Handbook.
This rigorous assessment process ensures that students demonstrate adequate knowledge and
skills in a controlled environment before progressing to patient care, meeting the GDC's
requirements for clinical readiness and patient safety.

Requirement 2: Providers must have systems in place to inform patients that they may be treated by
students and the possible implications of this. Patient agreement to treatment by a student must be
obtained and recorded prior to treatment commencing
Describe, in detail, your plans for meeting the requirement and how these plans assure you that the
requirement is/will be met

Patients referred from consultation clinics are fully informed that their treatment will be
provided by undergraduate students under the supervision of qualified dental professionals.
This information is conveyed during their triage appointments, where the implications of
student-led care are thoroughly discussed. Patients are then asked to provide written consent,
confirming their agreement to be treated by students. These consent forms are securely saved
in each patient’s clinical record as part of our documentation process.

Commented [Rr12]: I have re-written this section. please
check you are happy

In addition, for other clinical settings, the fact that treatment is provided by students is clearly
communicated through subject-specific informational materials, ensuring transparency. This
approach ensures that patients are well-informed about their care, and their explicit agreement
is obtained and documented prior to any treatment commencing. These systems are in place
to ensure compliance with GDC requirements and maintain the highest standards of patient
communication and consent.

treatments, such as complex conservative procedures, periodontics, dentures, or
indirect restorations.
d. BSc3 students are allocated patients requiring advanced periodontal care.
Pre-Clinical Discussions:
a. Each clinical session begins with a 30-minute pre-clinical discussion between staff and
students. During these sessions, cases are reviewed, treatment plans are finalised, and
the day’s clinical activities are planned. This ensures that students are well-prepared
and supported for their procedures.
Additional Support:
a. Floating staff, including Dental Core Trainees (DCTs) and postgraduate students from
prosthodontic and endodontic programmes, are available to provide additional
supervision and support to junior students. This enhances the quality of supervision and
