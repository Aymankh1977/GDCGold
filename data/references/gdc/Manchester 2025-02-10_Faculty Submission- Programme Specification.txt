Statement of details of the type of amendment proposed (e.g. change to programme title).
 Update to a programmatic linear structure as opposed to modular
 Update of programme learning outcomes to better reflect the new General Dental
Council (GDC) learning outcomes.
Documentation provided
 Programme Amendment Form
 Revised programme specification
Rationale for the amendment
The BDS undergraduate curriculum, including the learning outcomes, has not been updated
in over a decade. Over time, the curriculum has evolved organically, resulting in programme
learning outcomes that no longer accurately reflect the current structure. Additionally, the
General Dental Council (GDC) has introduced new standards that we must meet to
maintain accreditation and continue registering dentists. These standards will take effect
from September 2025.
As a result, a review of the current curriculum, including its learning objectives, was
necessary to modernise and revise the BDS programme. The programme follows a linear,
programmatic structure, which means that the original modular format described in the
programme specifications and marketing materials no longer accurately represents its
current design.

INTRODUCTION
Following its inception in the mid-2000s, The Manchester Dental Programme (TMDP) has
provided high quality dental education to students from the United Kingdom and internationally.
Its curriculum has been based around multiple core elements, specifically Enquiry-Based
Learning (EBL), seminars, symposia, simulation, and clinical and outreach placements. Each
year of study would build upon the previous year and knowledge acquired in previous years would
be readdressed throughout subsequent years in a spiral curriculum format.
In the early 2010s, the programme continued to score highly in national student survey (NSS), but
by the end of the decade and into the early 2020s, there had/has been a significant drop in
student satisfaction for a multitude of reasons including its administration and outdated content
which has not kept up with the evolution of dentistry and educational practices. Natural evolution
of the programme has resulted in large changes since programme inception. Additionally, there
was room to improve the lack of integration of EBL with other modalities of teaching.
Nevertheless, overall, it has remained compliant with the Standards from the General Dental
Council (GDC) - ‘Preparing for Practice’. To counter some of the issues several significant shortterm impact changes have been made to the programme (outlined in a later section).
In late 2023, the General Dental Council (GDC) released their new educational framework for
undergraduate dental curricula, the Safe Practitioner Framework, which will come into effect in
September 2025. In expectation of this, in summer 2023, a decision was taken to internally review
TMDP. This review aimed to ensure that TMDP not only complies with regulatory requirements but
also leverages the findings for the ongoing refinement of TMDP. To facilitate this process the
Undergraduate Programme Committee (UPC) and Divisional Leadership Team (DLT) established
the Curriculum Development Committee (CDC). An initial strategy/ phase was agreed by the
Curriculum Development Committee (CDC) to update our existing curriculum maps against the
current TMDP learning outcomes and the current GDC learning outcomes (Preparing for
Practice). Following this we were required to map the current curriculum against the new GDC
standards, producing a ‘Transition Action Plan’. Whilst we were able to successfully meet the new
GDC standards with our current map, there was a belief that TMDP should be revised to better
reflect the current programme, current dental practices, and changes that have been made over
time and particularly in the past three years.

STUDENT SUPPORT
All students admitted to the BDS Programme receive access to the Programme Handbook. This
handbook, updated annually in collaboration with current students, provides essential
information to support their transition to university life and the BDS Programme.
The first week of The Manchester Dental Programme (TMDP) is dedicated to induction activities.
These activities are designed to familiarise students with the resources and support available to
them at the University. During induction week, the Student Support and Wellbeing (SSW) team
delivers a tailored presentation to each year group.
Each academic year, students participate in scheduled Student Development Review (SDR)
meetings with their Year Lead. Prior to these meetings, students are required to submit a
summary of their progress along with personal reflections. These submissions guide the
discussions during the one-on-one SDR meetings, which are confidential in nature.
The SDR meetings provide an opportunity for students to discuss their academic progress,
personal challenges, and issues affecting their well-being, performance, or fitness to practise.
During the meeting, the Year Lead works with the student to develop an action plan, offering
guidance and referring the student to University Support Services or the Division of Dentistry’s
Pastoral Lead as necessary.
At the conclusion of the meeting, the student and Year Lead jointly determine whether the
student’s progress is satisfactory or if there are areas of concern. If concerns are identified, a
targeted action plan is created, and a decision is made about the need for a follow-up SDR
meeting within four to eight weeks. For significant concerns, the student may be referred to the
Student Progress Committee (SPC) or other relevant bodies.
The outcomes of SDR meetings are documented using the SDR Meeting Self-Assessment Form,
which is signed by both the student and the Year Lead. This record becomes part of the student’s
centrally maintained progress file.
In summary, the Year Lead’s role with regards to student support is to:
i)
ideally always be the initial point of contact for students requiring urgent support and
guidance.
ii)
facilitate students’ reflections on their personal and academic development using
the Student Development Review (SDR) Meeting Self-Assessment Form as a focus for
this reflection.
iii)
facilitate the development of an action plan.
iv)
refer the student for pastoral support if/when required
The School of Medical Sciences Student Support and Wellbeing (SSW) Team works
collaboratively with the Programme to provide support to students who are facing issues that may
impact their engagement with their studies or affect their ability to progress in their academic
journey.
The SSW team collaborates closely with the Undergraduate Pastoral Lead to meet with students,
address their concerns, and connect them with appropriate support tailored to their
circumstances. The team offers guidance on a wide range of issues, including support services,
mitigating circumstances, disability, accommodation, attendance, interruptions, withdrawals,
and more.

28

The SSW team maintain strong partnerships with various university support services, such as
Counselling, the Disability Advisory and Support Service (DASS), Occupational Health, Advice
and Response, and others, ensuring a comprehensive network of assistance.
Students typically self-refer but may also be encouraged to seek support by their academic staff.
Additionally, the School-Student Hub serves as a convenient drop-in point where students can
seek assistance with wellbeing, timetabling, and practical matters such as council tax letters,
accommodation, and financial advice.
The school also provides an online SMS student information Hub, offering a centralised resource
for forms, guidance, and information on various student-related queries.
The Information Advice and Guidance (IAG) team further fosters community and engagement
through social events like painting sessions, creating opportunities for peer connection and
support.
In TMDP the Pastoral Lead will:
i)
provide pastoral care and support to all undergraduate BDS and BSc OHS students.
The main aim of this support is to help students develop mature, effective learning
habits that will sustain them throughout their professional lives
ii)
lead the student support mechanism within the division
iii)
regularly liaise with colleagues within the division and provide support in fulfilling
their role by acting as both as a resource and a referral point to student support
iv)
refer students to DASS to provide exam support, support for coursework and to
provide special equipment for certain students.
v)
arranging targeted learning sessions for students who have demonstrated unsafe
practices in the clinic or have not passed a clinical gateway exam, ensuring they meet
GDC standards required for graduation.
vi)
attend the Sign Up and Sign Off meetings to support the progression and graduation
of the students
vii)
attend the Concerns Review Panel (CRP) to represent the student
viii)
work closely with the academic year leads, in particular regard to issues related to
Student Development Reviews (SDRs)
ix)
deal with Fitness to Practice (FtP) issues at School, Faculty, University and GDC levels
x)
report to Undergraduate Programme Committee (UPC) meeting
xi)
report to Assessment and Examination Group (AEG) meeting
xii)
report to the Staff-Student Liaison Committee (SSLC)

ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESSION
Assessment
Assessment is the means by which a student’s performance and achievement is measured.
There are five sets of ‘professional’ summative examinations (First, Second, Third, Fourth and
Final BDS Examinations) that must be passed for the purpose of progression or graduation. These
are held at the end of each respective year of study (with some in BDS 1 and 3 being held in
January of that year).
The end-of-the-year summative assessment could be presented in a variety of formats depending
on the level of knowledge, understanding, or skills being assessed. Such assessment could
comprise of Anatomy Spotter, Multiple Choice Question paper (MCQ), Objective Structured
29

Clinical Examination (OSCE), Short Answer Question paper (SAP), Unseen Structured Oral Exam
(viva style), and Coursework.
The summative exams are summarized in the table below:

The Anatomy Spotter, MCQ, SAP, and OSCE exams are standard set. The candidate’s raw score
is normalised so that their grid score is calculated based on the standard set pass mark
translated as 50%.
Unseen Structured Oral Exams and Coursework are intentionally marked based on pre-defined
marking guides and model answers. A minimum score of 50% is expected to pass such exams.
For all summative exams, a minimum score of 50% is required to pass each exam. There is no
compensable fail mark.
Students’ academic, clinical, and professional progress is assessed formally during the Sign-Up
process. The Sign-Up committee consists of the Assessment Lead (or their nominee), at least two
senior academics (typically academic year leads), the Student Well-being Lead (or their
nominee), and an External Examiner. The committee reviews a number of metrics for each
student, which are summarised in the table below:
The Sign-Up Committee reviews the following metrics for each student:
(1) Attendance (teaching sessions, clinical skills sessions, clinical sessions)
(2) Professionalism cards
(3) Successful completion of mandatory Gateway assessments
(4) Successful completion of expected Observed Milestones
(5) Successful completion of expected Written Milestones
(6) Completion of expected clinical targets
(7) Outcome of the Student Development Review (SDR) meeting
(8) Completion of CRP training

Attendance is monitored centrally by the University of Manchester though SEAtS system.
Evidence of commitment to the programme and satisfactory record of attendance is required to
satisfy the Sign-Up committee.
Professionalism cards are awarded by any members of staff (clinical and non-clinical) when poor
(amber and red) or exemplar (green) evidence of professional conduct is witnessed. Amber and
Red cards are discussed with the Academic Year Leads shortly after being awarded and may
result in Student Progress Committee (SPC) or Concern Review Panel (CRP) referrals. Patterns of
poor professionalism are discussed at the Sing-Up committee meeting.

Gateway assessments are observed capability assessments for certain key procedural skills
performed in a simulated (phantom head) condition. Each Gateway assessment consists of
several linked competencies. Each competency is assessed and marked individually. The grades
consist of Harm (H), Unsatisfactory (U), Satisfactory with Procedural help (Sp), Satisfactory with
Verbal prompts (Sv), Independent (I), and Experienced Independent (I+). The overall grade for the
Gateway assessment is the lowest grade awarded to any of the linked competencies. Grades of
H and U are deemed failure while the rest are pass. Successful completion of Gateway exercises
are prerequisite for a successful sign-up outcome as well as permission for students to treat
patients in need of certain procedures.
Observed and Written Milestones are assessment of clinical capability. Each Milestone consists
of several linked clinical competencies. Each competency is graded one of the following six: H,
U, Sp, Sv, I, or I+. The overall grade for the Milestone is the lowest grade awarded to any of the
linked competencies. A minimum grade of Sp is required to pass a Milestone. Typically, Observed
Milestones cover key procedures that can be completed in one sitting (for example; tooth
extraction and direct restorations), while Written Milestones cover key procedures that are
completed over multiple visits for example; provision of removable prostheses and root canal
treatment).
While TMDP is a competency-based curriculum, the students are expected to remain clinically
active and gain experience throughout the programme. For this reason, they are expected to
complete a minimum number of procedures, known as clinical targets. The clinical targets are
graded formatively and are used to reinforce reflection while encouraging learning and
experience.

Progression
The overall mark for a given year of a programme will be calculated as a weighted average of the
numerical marks awarded for each summative assessment.
The minimum overall pass mark will be 50% to progress from one year of the programme to the
next, in which the student must:
·
·

reach the minimum weighted average of 50% across all summative exams and;
obtain a at least 50% in each summative exam.

A student who fails to meet the above criteria will be reassessed in all units for which a pass mark
was not attained. Such reassessment is designed to assess achievement of the same intended
learning outcomes. The reassessment normally takes place in time for the student to progress at
the time originally intended. In order to progress, a student will be required to pass each unit
reassessed. The student will then be deemed to have obtained the credits necessary for
progression, however, the reassessment marks are capped at 50%.
A student who fails the reassessment and has no extenuating circumstances will be excluded
from the programme. Students who have successfully completed all summative assessments of
the first 3 years of the programme but failed the subsequent years may exit the programme with
the degree of B.Med.Sc.(Dent) as a fall-back qualification.

31

Classification Criteria
A student who obtains an overall weighted score of 70% or more over five years AND has obtained
an average weighted score of 75% or more in the Final year exams AND has obtained marks of not
less than 50% in each year of the programme will be considered for the award of Bachelor in
Dental Surgery (BDS) with Honours.

ADMISSIONS
BDS Undergraduate Admissions are led by the Academic Lead for Admissions (Dentistry).

COURSE DESCRIPTION AND SPECIAL FEATURES















Our Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) course will prepare the student for a
dentistry career through a combination of clinical study and basic and advanced
dental sciences.
The Manchester Dental Programme (TMDP) uses a blend of innovative, hybridised
teaching strategies that stimulate active learning, focussing where possible on
real-life clinical scenarios
The programme includes immersion into the discipline of dentistry, in the form of
tooth morphology courses; from the 1st week of 1st year, the students are placing
fillings in 3D CAD/CAM printed teeth, the earliest to our knowledge of any
undergraduate dental programme in the UK
Unique Selling Point (USP): TMDP is the first undergraduate dental programme to
use Team-Based Learning, a dialectic approach that overcomes the perceived
weaknesses of other forms of dialectic teaching methods, such as ProblemBased Learning
TMDP is programmatic, as opposed to modular in format taking the student on a
coercive journey from one year to the next, providing an integrated form of
education rather than standalone units and modules
A new progressive educational element addressing environmental sustainability
and social responsibility
Interdisciplinary learning- Learn alongside students and professionals from a
range of backgrounds, including those training in complementary professions
such as dental nursing and therapy.
Intercalation opportunities- study another subject to achieve a BSc award over
one year between Years 2 and 3 of the BDS course

TEACHING AND LEARNING







We use a range of teaching and learning methods on the course.
They will participate in a wide variety of different learning activities including
Enquiry-Based Learning (EBL) sessions, small-group seminars, themed theatre
events, case-based activities, computer-assisted learning (CAL), the use of webbased resources and project work.
The emphasis on EBL and TBL means that traditional lectures do not form a
major part of the course.
Enquiry-based learning (EBL)
o The tutor establishes the task and helps the process, but you will pursue
your own lines of enquiry, drawing on existing knowledge and identifying
your own learning needs.
283












Team-based learning (TBL)
o Alongside EBL, some of our teaching is via TBL, where you will benefit
from an active way of learning, working in small teams to tackle tasks,
solve problems and collaborate on a range of different exercises
together.
Critically Appraised Topics
o There is an emphasis on research throughout the course. Of particular
note is the use of Critically Appraised Topics (CAT), in which students
pose a clinical question, eg 'Is water fluoridation an effective means of
preventing tooth decay?', and assess the existing published literature to
draw conclusions.
o These might include suggestions for further research to add to the
existing evidence base or a strategy for implementing treatments where
the existing research evidence is strong.
o Through the review process, students will acquire skills that will equip
them to assess, in a meaningful way, new developments in dentistry
throughout their lifetime in practice. The reviews are added to our
database of critically appraised topics and published on our website.
Projects
o Throughout the course, they will complete a research project and a
clinical case presentation.
Lecture/symposium
o These are interdisciplinary-themed theatre events combining
presentations, clinical case presentations and interactive exercises.
Technical/laboratory
o Classes in laboratories, the anatomy dissection room and our
clinical/technical skills facilities are timed to complement the knowledge
they acquire through EBL/ TBL/ Symposia/ Lectures.
o These are designed to equip them with the competencies they will need
to treat patients during each stage of their development as student
dentists.
Clinic
o They will undertake clinical experience in a range of environments (dental
hospital, outreach community clinics), working in a dental team.

COURSEWORK AND ASSESSMENT
The course has been carefully designed to ensure that assessment is appropriate in
terms of both timing and quantity, and that there is consistency of assessment methods
throughout the course. These include:


multiple choice questions



short answer written papers



assessed projects

284



presentation of completed cases with companion oral examinations (sometimes
known as vivas)



objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) incorporating clinical
competency tests



peer assessment



reflective journal writing.

A 100% attendance record is expected for all teaching elements unless there are valid
reasons for absence. If the student has poor attendance records, they may not be signed
up to sit the end of year exams in any year of the course.
Integration and early clinical experience
The integration of non-clinical and clinical aspects of the course means that the
relationship of science subjects to the treatment of patients and disease elimination is
immediately apparent.
This philosophy allows for the rapid transfer of relevant research findings to the clinics.
You will be introduced to the clinical environment in the first semester of Year 1.
Outreach clinics
This course emphasises exposing the student to dentistry outside the confines of the
University and Dental Hospital through custom-built community clinics.
Treatment needs are high, there is no shortage of patients and you will gain valuable
experience of working as part of a team including dentists, dental nurses, hygienists,
therapists and receptionists.
Teamwork
The importance of teamwork is emphasised on the course. Alongside the BDS course, we
provide the BSc Dental Hygiene and Therapy course, which trains dental
hygienists/therapists.
Students drawn from different years of both courses work as a team to meet the
treatment needs of shared patients.
This helps you to experience true teamwork in a dental context throughout your time at
Manchester.

CURRICULUM
A key feature of the course is integration between theory and practice, and early
learning and teaching in the clinical context is central to this. As such, clinical subjects
are taught alongside the basic dental science subjects from Year 1.

285

This allows links to be made between the relationship of disease processes to body
structure and function, and the behavioural sciences to patient treatment.
The course is designed around five themes:
1. Human Health and Disease
2. The Mouth in Health and Disease
3. Clinical Competence:
o Diagnostic Skills
o Manual Skills and Dexterity
o Problem Solving
o Patient Management
4. Scientific Understanding and Thought
5. Team working, Communication Skills, ICT, reflective practice
Dedicated teams have worked to develop these themes to ensure that your knowledge
and skills develop over the five years of the course.

Benjamin Trill- BDS Curriculum Development Lead- Clinical Lecturer in Adult Oral Health
In the past three years several short-term impact changes have been made to our educational
approaches. Two early reports- ‘Blueprint for the Redevelopment of the BDS Restorative Teaching
Programme’ identified some shortfalls in the provision of enquiry-based learning. These
included:





Some teaching modalities were out of sync with the EBL
Variable student experience in EBL structure- different EBL groups interpreting cases
differently, students learning different content; resulting in a general lack of
standardisation amongst students and tutors
need for more structured didactic teaching in core concepts, for example, in restorative
dentistry and analgesia

Given these issues, several short-term changes were implemented to enhance the student
experience. All of these were tried as pilot courses (see Table 1) pending ratification by the Faculty
of Biology, Medicine and Health. The first major hybridised course was the "Tooth Morphology,"
which served as an important exercise in evaluating course structure and pedagogy. Additionally,
steps were taken to reintegrate different teaching modalities
A student-staff working group was held following some of our initial changes:.
A Student-Staff Working Group was held with the following key discussions/agreements:
Overall Course Structure
The re-integration of clinical skills/clinics, symposia, and EBL/TBL as core teaching modalities
was widely regarded as a logical and effective approach, given the current state of the curriculum.
The biosciences content is already well integrated, providing a useful reference point for further
strengthening the dental elements.
The introduction of formalised courses in periodontics, local analgesia, and tooth morphology
was unanimously welcomed and is expected to significantly enhance the student experience.
The adjustment to move endodontics to the third year, with an increased emphasis on
periodontics and direct conservation dentistry during the later part of the second year and early
third year, was viewed as a practical and beneficial change.
The reintroduction of complete denture prosthodontics into the second year, delivered as
workshops rather than patient-facing sessions, received universal approval.

There was also unanimous support for the development of handbooks to introduce course topics
and provide clear guidance for students.
Additionally, the inclusion of implantology training, which is currently absent from the
curriculum, was identified as a necessary enhancement.
Finally, it was recognised that further development of the occlusion teaching, building on the
existing curriculum, would be beneficial.
Enquiry-Based Learning (EBL) and Team-Based Learning (TBL)
The EBL component within the dental segment of the course presents an opportunity for
improved structure when compared to the biosciences. There is some variation in how cases are
interpreted and differences in tutoring styles, particularly as some tutors come from non-clinical
backgrounds. A more standardised tutor training programme would be beneficial, with a
preference for clinicians to serve as tutors, given their practical insights. The newly proposed
structured EBL objectives and guiding questions were well received, with agreement that they will
enrich the student learning experience.
The introduction of hybridised approaches, combining EBL and TBL, has been positively received
overall. The inclusion of pre-course reading, tRATs, and EBL case discussions has been
recognised as a thoughtful approach from Year 1 through to Year 4 of the BDS programme. Precourse reading materials, whether presented as a handbook or academic literature, were seen
as an effective way to introduce students to key topics. Additionally, the iRAT/tRAT assessments
were viewed as strong motivators for students to engage with the material in preparation for their
courses. Within the blended approach, the use of tRATs was particularly favoured over iRATs.
Symposia/Lectures
There is an opportunity to make didactic, lecture-based teaching for clinical dentistry more
clinically focused. For example, the teaching of biomaterials, currently delivered by nonclinicians or scientists, could be enhanced to align more closely with the practical needs and
expectations of clinical practice, ensuring that students receive information at a level that
supports their development as future clinicians.
Clinical Skills
Clinical skills courses were universally approved in content and how they are delivered. Within
the ‘blue-print’ no changes have been made to the general content of clinical skills courses at
this time. The only change is timetabling one- for example endodontics moving from 2nd year BDS
to 3rd year BDS.
Feedback within clinical skills manuals was considered effective.

290

Clinics
Students have expressed a desire for more detailed and personalised feedback during clinical
sessions. The current assessment system, ‘Identistry’, presents an opportunity for improvement,
as it does not require tutors to provide written feedback, which students feel limits the depth and
quality of their learning experience. Additionally, the system provides only broad feedback on
clinical elements rather than addressing specific components of each procedure.
The proposal for second-year BDS students to observe or assist senior students or clinicians was
met with universal approval as an effective strategy for enhancing clinical exposure and building
confidence through hands-on learning.
Following the meeting, several important and beneficial changes were implemented:

Continued introduction of new short-term impact courses (table 1)
Endodontics clinical skills course moved to the third year
Operative dentistry course moved into second semester of second year
Reintroduction of complete prosthodontics into second year- in the new restorative
theory module
Introduction of a Manchester Occlusion Course into 2nd and 3rd year BDS. With scheduled
courses to be introduced into 4th and 5th year in 2025 and 2026 respectively
The introduction of clinician level lectures- specifically within a restorative theory course
Further development introduction of Team-Based Learning (TBL) into the programme with
full conversion to dental TBL in the 2024/2025 year for 3rd year BDS
LAMS software adopted for TBL
2nd years reintroduced to clinics (2024 onwards)
Replacement of the Identity System to CAFs (2024 onwards).

Through these short-term impact courses, we also trialled an alternative dialectic form of
teaching, Team-Based Learning (TBL), which was integrated with other didactic forms. The flag
ship pilot courses for this were predominantly tooth morphology and basic periodontology. Shortterm impact data indicated high levels of student satisfaction, a preference over EBL and
improved academic performance with a hybridised approach.
Examples of feedback data:

In the 2023/24 academic year, team-based learning (TBL) became the primary teaching method
for the Primary Dental Care course for fourth-year BDS students. An informal evaluation
conducted on the day showed that 100% of the students in the year group preferred TBL over
EBL.
Due to the success of both hybrid and traditional forms of TBL, the third-year BDS curriculum
has been fully transitioned from EBL to TBL for the 2024/25 academic year.

2024- Staff-Student Working Group on Team-Based Learning and Clinics
Observations on Team-Based Learning (TBL)
Structured learning: Individual assessments at the start help you gauge your understanding of
the pre-teaching material.
Active engagement: Encourages active learning and keeps students focused throughout the
session.
Group discussions: Group discussions are valuable, with students justifying their answers,
leading to deeper understanding.
Effective tools: The LAMS software was highly regarded for its functionality.
Confidence indicator: The confidence tool was useful in prompting discussions and
understanding why peers chose certain answers.
Peer feedback: Seen as a good idea, but it would work best if feedback is anonymised.
Efficient staffing: TBL can reduce the pressure on staff, allowing specialists to lead sessions
without requiring a large number of facilitators.
Knowledge gaps: Individual assessments help students identify areas where they need
improvement.
Follow-up learning: Knowing they will be quizzed motivates students to complete the prereading.
Assessment weighting: There was a suggestion to incorporate test results into exam weighting
to increase engagement, although some felt using attendance as a marker would reduce
student anxiety.
Suggestions for Implementation:
Focus TBL on clinical years (Years 3-5).
Observations on Clinics

294

Holistic patient care: Integrating disciplines such as prosthodontics, periodontics, etc., within
the same patient treatment was seen as the best approach for learning how to treatment plan
comprehensively.
Pre-clinic seminars: 9am pre-clinic seminars have been helpful, though their scheduling could
be more consistent.
Consistency in teaching: There is a noticeable difference in teaching approaches between parttime and full-time staff, with students preferring a more uniform approach.
Pre-clinic session use: A suggestion was made to use pre-clinic time for reviewing treatment
plans and cases as a group rather than traditional teaching.
