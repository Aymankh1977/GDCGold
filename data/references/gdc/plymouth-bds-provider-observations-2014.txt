Dear James
Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS)
Awarding Body: Universities of Exeter and Plymouth (2009-2012 cohorts)
Plymouth University (2013 cohort onwards)
We were delighted to receive the GDC’s report following its full inspection of the Peninsula
Dental School’s BDS provision against the Standards for Education, and would like to take
this opportunity to extend our sincere thanks to the inspection team for their responsiveness,
their very constructive support and individual expertise.
We welcome the fact that the inspection team were impressed with many aspects of the
School’s work. In particular we are proud that the inspection team noted the positive student
feedback in terms of support, supervision and action within the School.
We were pleased to see the School has met 28 of the 29 requirements within ‘Standards for
Education’. The School has carefully considered all of the areas in which improvements
could be made, and has drawn up an Action Plan to address these. We are also actively
planning further developments in response to the panel’s helpful comments in relation to
Requirement 24 and will provide an update as requested in the 2015 Annual Monitoring
Exercise.
With very best wishes

Prof Christopher Tredwin
Head of Peninsula Dental School
